# LaTeX Template for Undergraduate Thesis at School of EECS, Peking University

The project's author is TBC. Based on TBC's code, I added the cover and reviewtable in branch 'cover'.

## In branch 'cover'

There are five .tex files:

* Template.tex
* Cover.tex
* ReviewTable.tex
* CoverHead.tex
* ReviewTableHead.tex

'Template.tex' is the main body of the project. You can write your thesis here.

'Cover.tex' designs the cover of this template.

'ReviewTable.tex' designs the reviewtable of this template.

'CoverHead.tex' and 'ReviewTableHead.tex' are head files for cover and reviewtable. They contain all packages needed for these two parts.

**There is no need to edit the last four .tex files. Everything you want to write is in 'Template.tex', including the words in the cover.**

'Template.pdf' is the output of this project.
